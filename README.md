## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

- [Prosta Matura](https://github.com/yourusername/project1) - Let me introduce you to my recent project, Prosta Matura. This initiative is designed to assist Polish students who are preparing for their advanced math matura examination. During my time as a high school graduate this year, I faced a challenge â€“ there wasn't a comprehensive platform consolidating all the exam tasks in one location. Driven by this need, I took it upon myself to create Prosta Matura.
- [Would You Rather](https://github.com/yourusername/project2) - I made this app for my friends' group to keep us entertained during school breaks. I take pride in it because it brought us much laughter and enjoyment while playing the simple "Would You Rather" game. The app also lets you create your own cards if you're interested.
- [Real Chat App](https://github.com/yourusername/project3) - This website was created for the purpose of receiving a scholarship called Lubuscy Zawodowcy. This is a quick information summary of one of the polish technician exam. It was very useful for me, because I could learn for it while I was making the website and for my friends that was using my "blog" and exercising before the exam. Pretty simple app without extended interactivity, nothing special at all.
